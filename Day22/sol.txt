The easy way to do this is using brute force

generate all possible sub arrays 

have a counter and then increment counter when == k 

return counter
 
this is O(n2) -> not very effiecient 


The other way is to have the cmumulative sum of the array 

and if substraction of any 2 cummulative sums == k then we add that to the
counter

to do this we can maintain a key value pair 
  dictionary in python or 
  unordered map in c++ or 
  generally known as a hash map 
  

this takes O(N) time only
