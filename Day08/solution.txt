The best way to find the middle of a linked list is by using the slow pointer
fast pointer method

lets say the lenght of the linked list is 100

slow point is at zero and so is fast pointer

after first iteration: 
	s -> 1 and f ->2 
	s -> 2 and f ->4
	.
	.
	.	
	.	
	.
	s -> 8 and f ->16

this way when f hits the end the s will be at the middle
